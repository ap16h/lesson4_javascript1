### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (I learned  a couple of interesting markdowns I could use for headers, emphasis on text, and images.)
2. (I learned how to make sure to check your code percisely when writing because I made a mistake at first and I could't figure it out until I saw I forgot "" or an end parenthasis.)
3. (I am starting to get more comfortable reading code and understanding what certain tags can do with a loosely typed language. I am enjoying the topics I'm learning.)
